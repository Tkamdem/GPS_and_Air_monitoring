# GPS_and_Air_monitoring
This project was carried out to be submitted in a program called Forge CC.
This code is to be uploaded to an arduino uno board to which DHT22 and SIM808 modules are hooked up.
The pin configuration can be obtained by going through the top portion of the code.
The project is open source so feel free to modify this project to suit your goals.

Note: Longitute and latitude data processing in this project is quite slow. Telemetry related to that
needs some more work.
